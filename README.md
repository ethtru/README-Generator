# README-Generator
Professional README Generator

## Description
This is a node application to generate a professional README file. When prompted, the user enters text to populate the file. 

## Approach
Inquirer was installed to set prompts for the user to input text for the various sections of a README file. In the root JavaScript file, 'fs' and 'generateMarkdow' were called in order to run the application effectively. The array of questions was created inside the 'questions' variable which is called in the 'init' function. 

## Contribution
Tutor Mila Hose assisted in the generateMarkdown file containing the functions to export to the root 'index.js' file.
